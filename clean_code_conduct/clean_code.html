    <h1>Clean Code Conduct</h1>
    <p class="date">May 21, 2025</p>
    <p>Writing clean code is more than just a technical skill—it's a mindset rooted in clarity, 
      discipline, and respect for future developers. Inspired by <i>Robert C. Martin's</i> 
      <strong>Clean Code</strong>, I've learned that readable, simple, and well-structured code 
      leads to better collaboration and easier maintenance. From meaningful names to small, focused 
      functions, the book emphasizes that every line of code should serve a clear purpose. Clean code 
      isn't about perfection—it's about writing with care and intention.

    <h2>Meaningful Grouping of Descriptive Naming in PHP</h2>
    <pre><code class="language-php">
      //GDI: Direct Fuel Injection
      global $currentSpeed, $accelerometerPrevTime, $gdiInterval;              
      global $bmwM1SysTime, $bmwM1SysAlertTime, $bmwM1SysLogTime;
      global $motor1RevSpeed, $motor1Temp, $motor1PrevLogTime;
      global $motor2RevSpeed, $motor2Temp, $motor2PrevLogTime;
      global $motor3RevSpeed, $motor3Temp, $motor2PrevLogTime;
    </code></pre>
  </section>

    <article class="post">
      <h2>Explanation</h2>
      <h3>Functional Grouping for Readability</h3>
      <p>The variables are grouped by their categories (e.g., <code>$motor1</code>, <code>$motor2</code>, <code>$motor3</code>), 
        which immediately communicates their relationship. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>$motor1RevSpeed</code>, <code>$motor1Temp</code>, <code>$motor1PrevLogTime</code> belongs to Motor 1's critical data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In <i>Clean Code</i>, Robert emphasizes that names and structure should reflect intent clearly. Here, structure itself reinforces meaning:</p>
      <blockquote>"Code should clearly reflect the problem it solves."</blockquote>
      
      <h3>Top-to-Bottom Dependency Structure</h3>
      <blockquote>"Readable code is maintainable code"</blockquote>
      <p>At the top, general-purpose vehicle data of <code>$currentSpeed</code>, <code>$accelerometerPrevTime</code> and <code>$gdiInterval</code> are defined. These are <strong>shared resources</strong> that the other vehicle segments depend upon. Placing them first follows a <strong>dependency-aware ordering</strong>, reflecting how data flows from a shared polling down into segment-specific behaviour. </p>
      <p>One of the core tenets of <i>Clean Code</i> is that code should be <strong>readable like prose</strong>. A developer skimming through the code can easily "scan" to the subsystem they're working on — similar to chapters in a well-organized book.</p>
      
      <h3>Easier Refactoring and Scalability</h3>
      <blockquote>“Minimize the number of concepts a reader must keep in mind”</blockquote>
      <p>As per Clean Code, developers shouldn't have to hold too many unrelated details in their minds. Here, through organising variables by vehicle segments, engineers can easily add, remove or refactor entire segments without affecting others. </p>
      <blockquote>“Code should be easy to change without fear”</blockquote>
      <p>For instance, if Motor 3 is being discarded or redesigned for lower end vehicle models, its variables are isolated, making it safe from interference or misassociation with Motor 1 or 2. This speaks directly to Robert's idea that clean code is <strong>change-friendly</strong> — vital in iterative or team-based development.</p>
      
      <h3>Debugging and Logging Benefits</h3>
      <p>If a bug arises in one segment's motor logic, this grouping allows engineers to quickly log or inspect only the relavent variables. For example, an <code>echo()</code> statement can be easily crafted for Motor 3 alone, without having to sift through unrelated shared variables.</p>

      <hr/><br/>
      <p>Although these are shared variables, this layout lays the groundwork for abstraction. For instance, in a more advanced version, these could evolve into dictionaries or classes, which will be shown in the next section.</p>

    <h2>Clear, Self-Documenting Code in PHP</h2>
    <pre><code class="language-php">
      $ecoPower = [
          "motor1" => $activate,
          "motor2" => $activate,
          "motor3" => $deactivate,
      ];

      foreach($ecoPower as $motor => $state) {
        $vehMode[$motor] = $state;
      }  
    </code></pre>
  </section>

  <article class="post">
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <h3>Meaningful Names</h3>
    <blockquote>"Use intention-revealing names."</blockquote>
    <p>No guesswork is required. The variable names express purpose, eliminating the need for comments.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>$ecoPower</code> clearly describes a configuration of motors in eco mode.</li>
      <li><code>$activate</code> and <code>$deactivate</code> are action-oriented and readable.</li>
      <li><code>$vehMode</code> logically suggests it stores the vehicle's operating mode.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Avoid Unnecessary Comments</h3>
    <blockquote>"Don't use comments to compensate for bad code."</blockquote>
    <p>The code doesn't need comments like <code>// Set vehicle mode</code> because the code already <strong>reads like natural language  </strong>.</p>

    <h3>DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</h3>
    <blockquote>"Duplication may be the root of all evil in software."</blockquote>
    <p>The code is concise and easily extendable—add a new motor by editing just the <code>$ecoPower</code> array.</p>
    <p>This avoids repetitive assignment like:<br/>
      <code>$vehMode["motor1"] = $activate;</code><br/>
      <code>$vehMode["motor2"] = $activate;</code><br/>
      <code>$vehMode["motor3"] = $deactivate;</code><br/>
      and replaces it with a loop, which is cleaner, scalable, and maintainable.

    <h2>Small, Focused Functions in PHP</h2>
    <pre><code class="language-php">
      function m1_motor1_temp_detection(){
        ...
      }
    </code></pre>
  </section>

  <article class="post">
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <h3>Single Responsibility Principle</h3>
    <blockquote>"A function should do one thing, and do it well."</blockquote>
    <p>The function m1_motor1_temp_detection() is clearly named to indicate that it performs a single task: 
      polling the temperature of Motor 1 in a BMW M1 car. It doesn't trigger outputs. This acieves the objectives:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Makes the function easy to reason about.</li>
      <li>Reduces the risk of unintended side effects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Avoidance of Magic Numbers in PHP</h2>
    <pre><code class="language-php">
      $kn = 1;
      $n = 0.001 * $kn;
      $activate = 1;
      $deactivate = 0;
    </code></pre>
  </section>

  <article class="post">
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <h3>Clarity Through Naming</h3>
    <blockquote>"A magic number is a literal that appears in code without explanation. Replace magic numbers with named constants to give them meaning."</blockquote>
    <p>The code is easier to read and understand. Instead of asking "Why is 1 used here?", the reader knows it's for activation.</p>

    <h3>Maintainability and Scalability</h3>
    <p>Changes in logic don't require scanning the whole codebase—one update changes all references.</p>

    <h3>Avoiding Hidden Logic</h3>
    <p>This avoids unexplained and contextless magic numbers like:<br/>
      <code>$throttle = 0.001;</code><br/>
      and replacing it with a standardised speed factor:<br/>
      <code>$throttle = 1 * $n;</code>
    </p>
    <p>By replacing magic numbers with named constant, it makes the logic transparent and intention-revealing, which is at the heart of clean, professional code.</p>

    <h2>Defensive Programming in PHP</h2>
    <pre><code class="language-php">
      if ($engineOverheat == true) {
        return null;
      }
    </code></pre>
  </section>

  <article class="post">
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <h3>Prevents Unsafe Execution</h3>
    <p>This condition checks if the engine is overheating — a critical failure state in any system. <br/>
      Instead of proceeding with further logic (which might involve controlling motors, updating UI, or logging data), the function exits early.
    </p>
    <p>The code is protecting the vehicle from executing under unsafe conditions, which could cause damage, instability, or invalid output.</p>

    <h3>Encourages Robustness</h3>
    <p>Defensive coding anticipates real-world unpredictability—e.g., sensor failures, user misuse, environmental hazards.</p>
